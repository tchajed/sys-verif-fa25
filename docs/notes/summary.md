# Summary of the class

In order to stabilize what you've learned in the class, take some time to recall what you learned and organize it. This outline gives you a concise summary of the topics we've covered.

## Functional programs

Inductive data types, recursive functions

Proofs by induction, computation, and rewriting

## Imperative programs

Hoare logic

Separation logic: separating conjunction, frame rule

Soundness of separation logic

Specifying abstract data types (representation predicates)

## Concurrent programs

Fractional permissions

Ghost variables

Lock invariants

Concurrent soundness theorem

Specifying concurrent abstract data types with atomic updates

## Rocq

Writing definitions and theorems

Writing proofs with tactics

Translating informal proof strategy to tactics

Interactive proofs: reading the context, finding existing lemmas
