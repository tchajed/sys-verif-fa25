# Inputting special symbols

One early question when you start using Perennial (and Iris, which it is based on) is "how do you type all those funny symbols?".

The answer is that these are simply Unicode characters, and we have some IDE setup to input them by typing their typical LaTeX commands; when I type `\forall` it automatically turns into `∀` (in a Coq file).

For this class, the setup should be performed for VS Code via the `.vscode/settings.json` file in the assignment repo.

In general (for other IDEs, for example) you should look at the [Iris editor setup instructions](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/iris/-/blob/master/docs/editor.md?ref_type=heads).

Once you have the setup, you'll need to use the right LaTeX commands. Here's a reference to the commonly used symbols, especially if you're less familiar with LaTeX.

| input | symbol | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\forall` | ∀ | forall quantifier |
| `\exists` | ∃ | exists quantifier |
| `\land` | ∧ | **l**ogical **and** |
| `\lor` | ∨ | **l**ogical **or** |
| `\sep` | ∗ | separating conjunction (note: not same as usual `*`) |
| `\mapsto` | ↦ | points-to for separation logic |
| `\lc` and `\rc` | ⌜ and ⌝ | brackets for pure propositions |
| `\"o` | ö | used to type Löb |
| `\union` | ∪ | map/set union |

Here are some notations that you don't have to use because they have ASCII equivalents, but you will see in existing code.

| input    | symbol | meaning                     | ASCII              |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `\leq`   | ≤      | less or equal               | `<=`               |
| `\to`    | →      | function type               | `->`               |
| `\named` | ∷      | used for named propositions | `::`               |
| `\gamma` | γ      | Greek letter gamma          | use any other name |

Note that `∀` and `∃` are overloaded for use in Rocq propositions and Iris propositions (`iProp`), and within Iris only the Unicode symbol is supported, so I recommend you stick with that. However, you can write `forall` and `exists` instead.

Note that for named propositions `\named` produces the Unicode symbol `∷` but you can use `::` (two ASCII colons) instead which looks almost identical in many fonts.

Similarly, `∧` can usually be written `/\` and `∨` can be written `\/`. I find in this case that the symbols are easier to type and look better. You'll also need `∨` within Iris, which doesn't support `\/` within an `iProp`.
